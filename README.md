# CSc8830-Computer-Vision
CSc 8830: Computer Vision Course Assignments

This repository contains solutions to multiple assignments along with web applications developed using the Python Flask framework.

## Requirements
- Python (version >= 3.0)
- Flask (install using `pip install Flask`)
- OpenCV (install using `pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (install using `pip install numpy`)
- SciPy (install using `pip install scipy`)
- Matplotlib (install using `pip install matplotlib`)
- qrcode (install using `pip install qrcode`)
- imutils (install using `pip install imutils`)
- depthai (install using `pip install depthai`)

## Assignment-1
- Solutions are provided in the Assignment-1.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
- The web application is designed using the Python Flask framework.
- To launch the web application, follow these steps:
  1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
  2. Install Flask by running `pip install Flask`.
  3. Navigate to the directory containing Assignment-1.
  4. Execute `python app.py`.
  5. Access the app running at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
- The web application in Assignment-1 is organized as follows:
  - `app.py`: Main Flask application file defining routes and handling requests.
  - `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for rendering web pages.
  - `static/`: Directory containing static files such as CSS and JavaScript.

## Assignment-2
- Solutions are provided in the Assignment-2.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
- The web application is designed using the Python Flask framework.
- To launch the web application, follow the same steps as Assignment-1.
- The web application in Assignment-2 is organized similarly to Assignment-1.

## Assignment-3
- Solutions are provided in the Assignment-3.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
- Some of the questions were answered in MATLAB in dedicated files with a .m extension.
- Live MATLAB script is also provided as a PDF file.

## Assignment-4
- Solutions are provided in the Assignment-4.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
- The web application is designed using the Python Flask framework.
- To launch the web application, follow the same steps as Assignment-1.
- The web application in Assignment-4 is organized similarly to Assignment-1.

### Note
Ensure that you have Python and Flask installed to run the web applications. Additionally, for Assignment-3, MATLAB may be required to execute the provided scripts.
